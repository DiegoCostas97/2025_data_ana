# WCTE_BRB_Data_Analysis

## To Do
- [ ] Update mapping so it includes the rest of the cards that are mPMTs
- [ ] Update the creation of the part_file DataFrame (and hence the df_all big DataFrame) so it includes all charge (summed) seen by the mPMTs per event
- [ ] Add plotting functions. For example, plotting the charge of given channel, group, etc, same for time and 2D Histograms
